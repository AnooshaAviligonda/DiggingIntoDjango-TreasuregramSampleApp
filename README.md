# Digging Into Django - Treasuregram Sample App
### The Treasuregram Sample App created in the Digging into Django course:
https://www.codeschool.com/courses/digging-into-django

The app displays a list of treasures with their images and descriptions that we've collected along our travels.

To build this app in the course we cover: 

1. Django template filters and adding a new detail page
2. Django Forms and Model Forms
3. Image Fields and image uploads
4. User Authentication
5. Django and AJAX to create a like button
